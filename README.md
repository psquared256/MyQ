# MyQ (Pronounced My-queue)

A simple web application designed to track virtual queues.  As I was primarily experienced with back-end development at the time of developing this application, the front-end is designed only to be functional.

### Set up (Local)

* Run the following commands in the root folder
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install app dependencies
	- Start the Flask application using the respective command:
	    - `python3 application.py` - on macOS/Linux
	    - `python application.py` - on Windows
